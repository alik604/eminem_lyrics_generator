to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry looking at me like it is lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i am on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line i said on i am back from the mathers lp 1 when i tried to say i will take seven kids from columbine put em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a

motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh he is too mainstream well that is what they do when they get jealous they confuse it it is not hiphop it is pop—cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make em lose it i do not know how to make songs like that i do not know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while i am ripping any one of these verses that versus you it is curtains i am inadvertently hurting you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice

but funky but in my head there is something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and heres what they want from me they are asking me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it lifes handing you lemons make

see people turnings making it seem worthless it is starting to defeat the purpose i am watching my fan base shrink to thirds and i was just trying to do the right thing but word has the court of public opinion reached a verdict or still yet to be determined cause i am determined to be me critiqued or worshipped but if i could go back i would at least reword it and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that he is deserted but i think it is working these verses are making him a wee bit nervous and he is too scurred to answer me with words cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered but i know at least he is heard it cause agent orange just sent the secret service to meet in person to see if i really think of hurting him or ask if i am linked to terrorists i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists but my beef is more media journalists hold up hold up hold up i said my beef is more meaty a journalist can get a mouthful of flesh and yes i mean eating a penis cause they have been panning my album to death so i have been giving the media fingers do not wanna turn this to a counseling sesh but they have been putting me through the ringer
